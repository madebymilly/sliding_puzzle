# Sliding Puzzle Game

Project from 2018. I created a sliding puzzle in Vanilla JS. 

Techniques: Pure JavaScript (ES6), no jQuery.

## Next steps:

- Randomize tiles more efficient and effective by using better algorithm
- Make game reponsive
- Add custom image upload
- Add history state to make moving back possible
- Count numbers of clicks to solve puzzle
- Count time it takes to solve puzzle
